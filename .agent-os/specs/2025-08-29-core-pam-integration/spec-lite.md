# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement basic Yubikey U2F authentication for all PAM-based system logins including sudo, su, login, gdm, and SSH, with safe configuration parsing and automated backup mechanisms. This foundation enables hardware-based two-factor authentication across Linux systems while preventing configuration errors through validation, timestamped backups, and session-based fallback to password authentication after 3 failed Yubikey attempts.
